# Welcome to My Portfolio

## Introduction
This is a portfolio website that showcases my personal and professional progress, projects, ideas, and a step into the journey in the world of web development. It is built in React using Vite's Framework and hosted on Vercel. A few pages are still under construction but it will be the gateway to access all of my web apps.
