# 🚀 Welcome to My Portfolio

## Introduction

Oh hi! This repo hosts my personal portfolio website, a showcase of my journey and projects in web development. Built using ⚡ **Vite** and ⚛️ **React**, and hosted on **Vercel**, this portfolio serves as a central point to explore my current and future web applications. It is continously updated with cool features and the Projects tab will be the gateway that redirects to all other webapps that I am building (around 11 planned, all coming soon)
